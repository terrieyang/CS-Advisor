# CS-Advisor
An 18 hr project built at SodaHacks 2018.

# Introduction
This skill can help UC Berkeley students choose computer science courses. 

Students can specify preferences such as 
* lower or upper division
* field of interest
* course difficulty 
* time commitment
* relevance to internships

The course advisor will then recommend and describe a course that matches the student's preferences.

# Usage

To activate this skill, say "Alexa, launch course advisor."
